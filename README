stlsc.nix
---------
a sacrificial tls certificate packaged as a nix flake

usage
-----
stlsc.nix is available as a flake and nothing else. Wire that up to your
derivation.

security
--------
no :). this is sacrifcial for a reason, and is just for spinning up quick
development environments for, e.g., gemini, where a tls certificate is a
requirement but a good one is not.

todos
-----
- set up automated testing
- set up automated updating

- docs:
  - put an example here
  - document the output files in result/

  in the mean time, just read the very tiny derivation
