stlsc.nix
---------
a sacrificial tls certificate packaged as a nix flake

usage
-----
stlsc.nix is available as a flake and nothing else. Wire that up to your
derivation.

Produced files:

TODO: put an example here.
TODO: actual docs (in the mean time, just read the very tiny derivation)

alternate usage
---------------
if you don't need to integrate this into a build system, you can just pull the
latest built and checked certificates from CI. Because of the deps bot, these
should never get much more than a week old.

security
--------
no :). this is called sacrifcial, and is just for spinning up quick development
environments for, e.g., gemini, where a tls certificate is a requirement but a
good one is not.
